# Hi there, I'm Mohammed ðŸ‘‹

As a software engineer with a strong desire to learn new technology, I have experience writing programs in both C and Python and prefer to work in a Linux environment. I am dedicated to staying current with the latest developments in my field and am always eager to take on new challenges and learn new skills.
